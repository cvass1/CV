## Skills

#### Analytics & Problem Solving

I have a strong analytical skill set which I gained from my scientific studies and developed throughout my career building analytical tools, monitoring financial market data and using unique insights to make decisions on strategies and risks.

#### Communication & Team Work

During my career I have developed strong communication skills through daily interactions with management and other internal stakeholders to convey risk metrics, market conditions and strategic views in a timely and accurate manner. I have also developed strong team working skills, particularly having worked for a multinational company where I've needed to be organised and flexible to communicate and collaborate with members of my team globally.

#### Resilience & Work Ethic

I enjoy being challenged and have built up resilience and a strong work ethic from working extended hours under high pressure to solve problems and execute strategies as quickly and successfully as possible.

## Hobbies

I love to travel! In 2017, I took a 10 month sabbatical to travel to 20 countries across 5 continents and every year since I've tried to go to somewhere new. I enjoy meeting new people, learning about other cultures, tasting all the exciting food and exploring new places.
