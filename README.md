## Skills

#### Analytics & Problem Solving

I have a strong analytical skill set which I gained from my scientific studies and developed throughout my career building analytical tools, monitoring financial market data and using unique insights to make decisions on strategies and risks. At Makers Academy, I enhanced my problem-solving skills by embracing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practices, enabling me to dissect intricate challenges into simpler steps with efficiency and clarity.

#### Communication & Team Work

During my career I have developed strong communication skills through daily interactions with management and other internal stakeholders to convey risk metrics, market conditions and strategic views in a timely and accurate manner. I have also developed strong team working skills, particularly having worked for a multinational company where I've needed to be organised and flexible to communicate and collaborate with members of my team globally. At Makers Academy I further amplified these abilities through agile methodologies, delivering successful products efficiently and effectively in collaborative team projects.

#### Resilience & Work Ethic

I enjoy being challenged and have built up resilience and a strong work ethic from working extended hours under high pressure to solve problems and execute strategies as quickly and successfully as possible. This determination to excel extends to my journey in coding, where I've embraced challenges with the same tenacity.

## Hobbies

I love to travel! In 2017, I took a 10 month sabbatical to travel to 20 countries across 5 continents and every year since I've tried to go to somewhere new. I enjoy meeting new people, learning about other cultures, tasting all the exciting food and exploring new places.
